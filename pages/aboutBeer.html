<h2>Random Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
        The short, stubby, 11.2-ounce Duvel-style bottle releases a dark, leathery-brown brew, with
        a tan-colored, super-tight, creamy, fluffy lacing. Amazing head retention. Malted milk balls,
        spicy yeast and a soft herbal Saaz aroma. As soon as the beer hits the palate, it creams up with a
        light and fluffy feel and lively carbonation. Slight up-front sharpness, a meld of light hop bitterness
        and slight medicinal phenols, with a warming alcohol bite riding its wake. Notes of pith and leaf.
        Herbal tea and a tease of pepper tucked beneath a moderate residual sweetness, with flavors of toffee,
        brown bread, dried fruits and fermented honey. Some spice emerges from the alcohol as it warms.
        Finish goes dry, with some residual malt sweetness and bready yeast in the back.

    <p>
        Incredibly smooth and creamy, nearly full-bodied and a bit viscous. More body than the appearance leads
        you to believe. The <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Malt" target="_blank">maltiness</a> comes across
        first, with a distinct toasty
        character, followed by bread crusts and a thin honey-like sweetness. Slightly sticky and resiny berry-like
        flavors smooth out the malty sweetness, with a slight tart edge that's gone in a flash, leaving an
        interesting gin-like bite. Finishes with a touch of residual maltiness and a flavored-iced-tea-like linger,
        with a slowly drying palate.

    <p>
        A massive, fizzing, dense coffee-colored head rises from the pour and settles to a foam lace. Deep, rich
        , nearly opaque black, with ruby hues around the edges. Soft but distinct fresh coffee grounds in the nose
        , along with chocolate and roasted notes. Smooth, firm and even in the mouth, and not too heavy. Quite
        acrid up front, with a mouthful of roasted astringency, char, a sharp and semi-sour bite and a weakish
        watery hop flavor of the rind-like citrus variety just beneath the sourness. Minimal sweetness provides
        little balance, and allows the dryness of the beer to dominate. Smoky undertones. Bone-dry finish with
        residual roasted, stale-ish coffee grounds and acrid flavors lingering, not overly pleasant, too tannic-like.

<h2>More Thoughts</h2>

    <p>A rich-looking, deep-copper-hued beer, leaning toward the dark side, with an off-white foam head that drops to a fine ringed lace. Aroma is unique. Uniquely British, with a suggestion of dryness, metallic hints, prominent nutty malt character, interesting orchard-esque notes, deep caramel beneath, toasty and soft powdery spices. Lively in the mouth, with a slightly crisp carbonation that peaks and provides some creaminess. Medium, even-bodied, with a round fullness about it. Quite dry up front, with slightly abrasive raw, leafy and pithy characters mixed with some tamed hop bitterness. Wood and earth? Yeah, a bit. Some fruity and berry-like tartness, reminiscent of holiday pie fillings and plump, juicy, almost over-ripe black cherries. Definite apple flavors follow fruit, as well as juicy pear. Robust and heart as far as beers go. Toasty malts, bready, crust-like. Watery toffee, with hints of vanilla beneath. Dusting of cinnamon. Orange zest flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms, pulling through toward the finish. Man, this beer is all over the place. Quite dry in the finish, with a lingering yeasty character, touch of toasty sweetness and a bitey feel on the palate.</p>

    <p>Arriving in a 22-ounce brown bomber, this ale clocks in at 62 IBUs, which tells us there is a substantial amount of hops here, and a hefty 7.9 percent alcohol by volume speaks for itself. Decent amount of foam that holds together to form a chunky-looking head with good retention. Crystal-clear copper hue. Juicy aroma, pear-like fruity esters, rosewater, soft herbal tones and a hint of spicy alcohol in the back. Full-bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel, very smooth and creamy. Loads of hop oil up front, herbal almost like nectar. Really juicy with an intermingled fruitiness of mango, pear and melon. Then the fruity esters show their real source with a warmth and spice of balanced alcohol; and bitterness has a go on the taste buds with a semi-puckering dryness. The malt character drops in fashionably late with undertones of toasted biscuit. The finish is a tad sweet, though if the hops fade with a bit of age and the alcohol goes a bit vinous, then, with time, this beer will turn into a different beast altogether.</p>
